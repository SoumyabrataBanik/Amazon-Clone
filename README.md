# Amazon-Clone

In this project, I have tried to clone the Amazon Website. This project is built using simple vanilla HTML and CSS. 

This is also one of the first projects that I built when I was practicing about web development. 

This project isn't responsive. 

In fact it does not do much. 

But this project still holds a special place in my heart because this is the project that made me fall in love with Web Development.

You can easily clone the repository and run it locally on your computer using a "Live Server".

I case you are in a hurry, here is the link to the clone: https://soumyabratabanik.github.io/Amazon-Clone/

You can visit the above link. But do note that this is not a responsive website. So, it will not work properly on a mobile.
